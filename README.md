IncubatorQ1

This is one of the questions I answered for The Data Incubator fellowhship. It is written in Python. It describe an ant's random path to a coordinate m,n. And it calculates via a defined metric, max(x/m - y/n, y/n - x/m), the probability and conditional probability of the ant's deviation from the ideal path (straight path).

I've also added the shortest distance to the straight line at every point x,y the ant is at.
